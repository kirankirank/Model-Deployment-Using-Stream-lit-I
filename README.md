# Model-Deployment-Using-Stream-lit-I





•	So first we will train our model. We will not do much pre-processing as the main aim of this article is not to make an accurate ML model but to show its deployment.
          
          
Firstly we need some necessary libraries like as following –

	pip install pandas

	pip install numpy

	pip install sklearn

	pip install streamlit



•	After installing the libraries create new python file in the same  directory.


•	In this article, we will first train the car fuel efficiency regression and then deploy the model using Stream lit which is an open-source app framework used to  deploy ML models easily.


•	After completion of training we save this model using pickle or joblib library.


•	Save the python file[remember the current directory].



•	More information can be found on their website – https://www.streamlit.io/



•	In that new file import the libraries write and read the  pickle or joblib file using variable.


•	Finally write the stream lit related code on the same file and save it.


•	Finally go the current directory using anaconda commend prompt type “streamlit  streamlit_file_name.py” 


•	You will get the link for the streamlit on the commend prompt.


•	The out put will be look like as show in below  .
